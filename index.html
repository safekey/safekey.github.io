            <h2>The problem with campus security</h2>
            <p>Campus crime is on the rise. While the number of reported arrests has been decreasing steadily,
                the strong feeling among students is that they are not safe on campus.
                This feeling is due to the outdated and ineffective ways students must report crimes.
                Cell phones are carried by nearly every college student, but they are also the
                number one targeted item by thieves and assailants.
                With the unsettling feeling shared by our fellow students, faculty, and parents of students,
                we set out to solve the growing problem of campus safety,
                and restore peace-of-mind by creating Safekey - the world's
                fastest and only internet-connected crime response device.

            <h1>Our solution</h1>
            <h3>Making emergency response as easy as locking a car</h3>
            <p><span class="image left"><img style="max-width: 80px;" src="images/solution/fob.png" alt=""/></span>
                We thought it was crazy that unlocking your car is faster and more reliable than calling for help in an emergency.
                So we invented Safekey, an internet-connected key fob that gives you real-time access to police.
                At the push of a button, police not only know who you are, but where you are, and where you will be.
                The process of unlocking a mobile phone, finding your dialer, calling 911, and describing your situation can now be done from your pocket.
            </p>
            <h3>Safekey was designed by students, for students</h3>
            <p><span class="image left"><img style="max-width: 80px;" src="images/solution/cloud.png" alt=""/></span>
                Safekey runs on a rock-solid distributed system. This means we're there for you when nobody else is.
                Surveys suggest that notifying friends is among the most common form of protection amongst students.
                While this is a good idea, friends are usually not as reliable as full-time officers, and can be slow to react.
                Safety is everyone's concern - with Safekey, it's our business.
            </p>
            <h3>Seamless integration with local law enforcement</h3>
            <p><span class="image left"><img  src="images/solution/police.jpg" alt=""/></span>Mobile apps that notify your family if you are in danger exist, and they work well... for notifying your family and friends.
                What students really need is a way to discreetly and easily notify authorities that something just isn't right. The majority of crimes could be stopped if someone had simply reported them.
                The issue still exists, students don't report crimes.
                With Safekey, it's safer and easier than ever to report crimes!
                Because Safekey is directly integrated with local police, students can rest assured their calls will be answered, REST API calls that is.
            </p>

                    <h3>It's lightening fast</h3>
                    <p>From button push to police receiving the message - Safekey has a round-trip time of 3 seconds.
                        That means police know who is in trouble, that they're in trouble, and where they are located within 3 seconds of button push.</p>

                    <p>Safekey devices are produced with quality in mind. Luckily, this quality doesn't have to come at a high price. Safekey devices are manufactured
                        cheaply thanks to modern semiconductor technology.

                    <p>Safekey was first presented at the Senior Design Symposium where it was part of a larger project
                        known as Cerebro (also built by this team).
                        Cerebro used a network of cameras equipped with advanced computer vision algorithms developed by
                        the team to track criminals as they fled the
                        scene of a crime. The crimes were reported using Cerebro HelpKey (now Safekey). Our project took
                        first place out of 300 engineers.
